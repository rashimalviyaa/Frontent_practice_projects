    <h3> CHUREITO PAGODA!</h3>

<p>The Chureito Pagoda (忠霊塔, Chūreitō) is a five storied pagoda on the mountainside overlooking Fujiyoshida City and Mount Fuji off in the distance. The pagoda is part of the Arakura Sengen Shrine and was built as a peace memorial in 1963 nearly 400 steps up the mountain from the shrine's main buildings.

    The location offers spectacular views of Mount Fuji in combination with the pagoda, especially during the cherry blossom season in mid April when there are hundreds of trees in bloom and during the autumn color season which usually takes place in the first half of November. The spot is particularly popular among photographers as it allows for some wonderfully stereotypical shots of Japan. </p>

<h3> TOKYO TOWER! </h3>

<p>
Tokyo Tower is separated into three distinct sections. Foot Town sits at the base of the tower and is a vibrant area of cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops.

The Main Deck is located 150 meters up and offers memorable views of the city as well as a “look-down” window—not for the faint-hearted.

For truly spectacular views, however, seek out the Top Deck. A heady 250 meters in the sky, this point has panoramic views of the metropolis below and, weather allowing, Skytree and even Mt. Fuji on the horizon.

<H3> MT. FUJI!</H3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">

<p> Formed approximately 100,000 years ago, repeated volcanic eruptions gradually transformed Mt. Fuji into the largest mountain in Japan, at 3,776 meters tall. The last eruption in 1707 lasted for 16 days, with volcanic ash reaching as far as Tokyo. Volcanic activity is also responsible for creating Hoeizan (one of Fuji's secondary peaks), the five lakes at the mountain's base, and numerous caves near Aokigahara Forest. The area is also blessed with many mineral-rich hot springs, making the region a paradise for both outdoor recreation and relaxation.</p>

<p>Japan is one of the most exciting places in the world for online sellers. As well as being the third largest ecommerce market in the world with excellent logistics infrastructure and a domestic population that has significant purchasing power, consumers have a strong appetite for Western products</p>
